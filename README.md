# My-First-Website-page-using-HTML-

This project is my first step into the world of web development. 🌐  
I created a simple, static website using only **HTML** — no CSS or JavaScript — to strengthen my understanding of basic web structure and elements.

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Writing HTML from scratch
- Using basic tags like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, and more
- Structuring a web page
- Hosting my code using GitHub

## 📌 Future Goals
- Add CSS styling to improve design
- Make it mobile responsive
- Try adding JavaScript for interactivity

Thank you for checking out my first web project! 🌟
